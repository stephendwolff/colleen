deletefield.py now unnessary thanks to discovery of the jq tool.

to strip 'user' field from json use:
cat withuser.json | jq '[.[] | {id, location, project, subject, timestamp, user_id }]' > userstripped.json

to get largest id from live classifications db:

curl 'https://live.zooniverse.org/classifications/10'  | jq '[.[] | .id] | max'

to filter documents with id field less than or equal to 1808632
jq '.[]  | select(.id > 1808632)'

run on cron
get maxid of most recent file
get latest classifications with ids greater than that and
save into file called <maxid_of_previous_file>.json
import each new json file into mongo
optionally cleanup files older than X
